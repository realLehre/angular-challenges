The goal of this series of 3 pipe challenges is to master **pipe** in Angular.

Pure pipes are a very useful way to transform data from your template. The difference between calling a function and a pipe is that pure pipes are memoized. So they won't be recalculated every change detection cycle if their inputs haven't changed.

## Information:

In this first exercice, you call a simple function inside your template. The goal is to convert it to a pipe.

## Constraints:

- must be strongly typed
